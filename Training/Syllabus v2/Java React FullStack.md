### Assignment 1: Social Media News Feed System
#### Context
The existing social media platform has grown from 100,000 to 1 million daily active users in the last six months. The current monolithic architecture struggles with feed generation, causing significant delays and occasional system crashes during peak hours. Users report feeds taking up to 30 seconds to load, and new posts take several minutes to appear in followers' feeds.

#### Current System Challenges
- Single-server architecture cannot handle the increasing load
- Feed generation happens synchronously, blocking user requests
- Posts are stored in a single database instance
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed content
- All media content is stored and served from the same server

#### Requirements
The platform needs a redesigned news feed system that can:
- Support 10 million daily active users with potential for 10x growth
- Handle 100,000 concurrent users during peak hours
- Process 500 new posts per second
- Deliver feeds to users in under 100ms
- Support text posts, images (up to 5MB), and videos (up to 200MB)
- Allow users to follow up to 5000 other users
- Maintain feed consistency across multiple devices
- Support infinite scroll with pagination
- Provide real-time updates for new posts from followed users
- Handle temporary service degradation gracefully

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- High Availability: 99.99% uptime
- Low Latency: Feed generation under 100ms for 99th percentile
- Eventually Consistent: New posts must appear within 5 seconds
- Scalable: Horizontal scaling for user growth
- Fault Tolerant: No single point of failure
- Cost-Effective: Optimize storage and processing costs

#### Deliverables
1. System Architecture Diagram
   - Feed generation service
   - Storage components
   - Caching layers
   - Load balancers
   - CDN integration

2. Design Decisions Document
   - Feed generation approach (pull vs push)
   - Caching strategy selection
   - Content delivery approach
   - Scalability considerations

### Assignment 2: Real-Time Gaming Leaderboard
#### Context
A popular mobile gaming company's current leaderboard system is struggling with scale. The game has grown from 100,000 to 5 million daily active players. Players complain about incorrect rankings, delayed score updates, and inconsistent leaderboard views across regions.

#### Current System Challenges
- Score updates take up to 5 minutes to reflect
- Regional leaderboards often show inconsistent rankings
- System crashes during tournament endings
- Cannot handle more than 1000 concurrent score updates
- Limited historical data storage
- No support for different tournament types

#### Requirements
The new leaderboard system must:
- Handle 10 million daily active players
- Process 5000 score updates per second
- Support multiple leaderboard types (daily, weekly, all-time)
- Provide real-time ranking updates (< 1 second delay)
- Support tournament-specific leaderboards
- Handle regional and global rankings
- Store historical data for 6 months
- Support player statistics and achievements
- Enable real-time notifications for rank changes
- Support different game modes and categories

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- High Availability: 99.99% uptime
- Low Latency: Ranking queries < 50ms
- Eventually Consistent: Score updates visible within 1 second
- Scalable: Support 2x yearly growth
- Regional Support: Multiple geographic regions
- Cost-Effective: Optimize for read-heavy workload

#### Deliverables
1. System Architecture Diagram
   - Score processing services
   - Storage components
   - Caching layers
   - Regional distribution

2. Design Decisions Document
   - Real-time update strategy
   - Consistency model selection

   - Regional deployment strategy

### Assignment 3: Digital Banking System
#### Context
A traditional bank with 2 million customers is modernizing its legacy banking system. The current system suffers from nightly maintenance downtimes, cannot handle modern digital banking features, and has security vulnerabilities. Mobile app users experience frequent transaction failures.

- Support 10 million customers with 100% growth yearly
- Process 2000 transactions per second
- Handle multiple account types and currencies
- Provide real-time transaction processing
- Support international wire transfers
- Implement robust fraud detection
- Enable instant payments and transfers
- Support mobile and web banking interfaces
- Maintain complete audit trails
- Handle complex financial products

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- High Availability: 99.999% uptime
- Strong Consistency: No double-spending
- Low Latency: Transactions processed < 500ms
- Security: PCI-DSS and regulatory compliance
- Data Privacy: GDPR and banking regulations
- Disaster Recovery: RPO < 1 second, RTO < 30 seconds

#### Deliverables
1. System Architecture Diagram
   - Transaction processing
   - Authentication services
   - Fraud detection
   - Backup systems

2. Design Decisions Document
