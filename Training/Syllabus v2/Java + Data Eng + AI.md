## Assignments
### Assignment Guidelines
Each assignment should include:
1. High-Level System Design
   - System architecture diagram
   - Component interactions
   - Data flow
   - Key subsystems

2. Architectural Decisions Document
   - Technology choices with justification
   - Scaling strategies
   - Caching approaches
   - Storage solutions
   - Trade-offs made

### Assignment 1: Social Media News Feed System
#### Context
The existing social media platform has grown from 100,000 to 1 million daily active users in the last six months. The current monolithic architecture struggles with feed generation, causing significant delays and occasional system crashes during peak hours. Users report feeds taking up to 30 seconds to load, and new posts take several minutes to appear in followers' feeds.

#### Current System Challenges
- Single-server architecture cannot handle the increasing load
- Feed generation happens synchronously, blocking user requests
- Posts are stored in a single database instance
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed content
- All media content is stored and served from the same server

#### Requirements
The platform needs a redesigned news feed system that can:
- Support 10 million daily active users with potential for 10x growth
- Handle 100,000 concurrent users during peak hours
- Process 500 new posts per second
- Deliver feeds to users in under 100ms
- Support text posts, images (up to 5MB), and videos (up to 200MB)
- Allow users to follow up to 5000 other users
- Maintain feed consistency across multiple devices
- Support infinite scroll with pagination
- Provide real-time updates for new posts from followed users
- Handle temporary service degradation gracefully

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- High Availability: 99.99% uptime
- Low Latency: Feed generation under 100ms for 99th percentile
- Eventually Consistent: New posts must appear within 5 seconds
- Scalable: Horizontal scaling for user growth
- Fault Tolerant: No single point of failure
- Cost-Effective: Optimize storage and processing costs

#### Deliverables
1. System Architecture Diagram
   - Feed generation service
   - Storage components
   - Caching layers
   - Load balancers
   - CDN integration

2. Design Decisions Document
   - Feed generation approach (pull vs push)
   - Caching strategy selection
   - Content delivery approach
   - Scalability considerations

### Assignment 2: Real-Time Gaming Leaderboard
#### Context
A popular mobile gaming company's current leaderboard system is struggling with scale. The game has grown from 100,000 to 5 million daily active players. Players complain about incorrect rankings, delayed score updates, and inconsistent leaderboard views across regions.

#### Current System Challenges
- Score updates take up to 5 minutes to reflect
- Regional leaderboards often show inconsistent rankings
- System crashes during tournament endings

**Objective**: This assignment will test your ability to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), clean data, and transform it into a format suitable for predictive analysis and aggregation tasks. [MBA](https://github.com/Training10x/DataEngineering/blob/main/Data/MBA.csv) Datasets.
#### Dataset Fields
The dataset includes the following fields:
- **application_id**: Unique identifier for each application
- **gender**: Applicant's gender (Male, Female)
- **international**: International student status (TRUE/FALSE)
- **gpa**: Grade Point Average on a 4.0 scale
- **major**: Undergraduate major (Business, STEM, Humanities)
- **race**: Racial background (e.g., White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Other, or null for international students)
- **gmat**: GMAT score (out of 800)
- **work_exp**: Years of work experience
- **work_industry**: Industry of previous work experience (Consulting, Finance, Technology, etc.)
- **admission**: Admission status (Admit, Waitlist, or Null for Deny)

#### Assignment Tasks
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**:
   - Load the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.
   - Display a summary of the dataset to inspect field names, data types, and the first few rows.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - **Rename Columns**: Rename `work_exp` to `experience_years` and `gmat` to `gmat_score`.
   - **Handle Null Values**:
     - For `gpa`, `gmat_score`, and `work_exp` columns, replace nulls with the median of each column.
     - Fill missing values in the `admission` column with `Deny`.
     - Assume null values in `race` are `International`.
   - **Add Conditional Columns**:
     - Create a column `admission_numeric` with values: 1 for Admit, 0 for Waitlist, and -1 for Deny.
     - Create a column `experience_level` based on `experience_years`:
       - `Entry-level` if experience is 0â€“2 years
       - `Mid-level` if experience is 3â€“6 years
       - `Senior` if experience is more than 6 years

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Calculate the average GMAT score and GPA for each `major`.
   - Find the percentage of applicants admitted by `work_industry`.
   - Determine the distribution of `experience_level` among applicants by `gender`.
   - Show the average GPA and GMAT scores by `race` and `international` status.

4. **Aggregation and Insights**:
   - Calculate the admission rate for international vs. domestic applicants.
   - Find the top 3 undergraduate majors with the highest admission rates.
   - Show the average work experience and GPA for admitted vs. denied applicants.
   - Calculate the overall average GPA and GMAT score by `admission` status.

5. **Prediction Dataset Preparation**:
   - Create a final dataset with the following features to predict `admission_numeric`: 
     - `gpa`, `gmat_score`, `experience_years`, `major`, `gender`, and `work_industry`.
   - Save the final dataset as a CSV file for future predictive modeling.

6. **Save the Results**:
   - Save the cleaned DataFrame as a CSV file.
   - Save each of the key aggregations (admission rates, averages, distributions) as separate CSV files.

#### Submission
1. Submit the cleaned DataFrame in CSV format.
2. Submit CSV files for each of the aggregations and insights derived from the dataset.
3. Provide your code in a `.py` file or Jupyter notebook with detailed comments explaining each step.
