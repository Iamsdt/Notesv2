## Testing Syllabus: FastAPI Microservice with React Frontend


**Target Audience:** Testers of all levels, aiming to gain proficiency in testing modern web applications built with microservice architecture.

**Course Structure:**

The syllabus is divided into modules, each focusing on specific testing types and levels. Each module will include:

* **Theoretical concepts:** Introduction to the testing type and its importance.
* **Practical examples:** Real-world scenarios and examples relevant to the application.
* **Tools and techniques:**  Introduction and utilization of relevant tools and libraries.
* **Hands-on exercises:** Practical tasks and assignments to reinforce learning.

**Modules:**

**1.  Foundations of Testing**

    * Importance of software testing.
    * Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and testing phases.
    * Types of software testing: Functional vs. Non-functional.
    * Testing levels: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance.
    * Test planning, test cases, and test execution.
    * Bug reporting and tracking.
* **Testing in a Microservice Architecture:**
    * Challenges and benefits of testing microservices.
    * Understanding service dependencies and communication.
    * Testing approaches for microservices: contract testing, end-to-end testing, etc.

**2.  Unit Testing (Python + React js)**
* **Introduction to Unit Testing:**
    * Principles of unit testing: isolation, automation, repeatability.
    * Test-Driven Development (TDD) and its benefits.
    * Unit testing frameworks: pytest, vitest
    * Mocking dependencies and external resources.
* **Testing Backend Endpoints:**
    * Testing API routes, request methods, and parameters.
    * Validating responses: status codes, headers, and data.
    * Handling errors and exceptions.

**3.  Integration Testing (Python )**
* **Integration Testing in a Microservice Environment:**
    * Strategies for integration testing: Big Bang, Top-Down, Bottom-Up.
    * Testing interactions between microservices.
    * Tools for mocking and simulating dependencies.
* **Testing Backend with Databases and External Services:**
    * Integration testing with databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    * Testing interactions with external APIs and services.
    * Using test databases and environments.

**4.  End-to-End Testing (React Frontend)**
* **Introduction to End-to-End Testing:**
    * Simulating user interactions with the application.
    * Testing the entire system flow from UI to backend.
* **End-to-End Testing with Cypress:**
    * Setting up Cypress for testing React applications.
    * Selecting elements, simulating user actions, and assertions.
    * Intercepting network requests and stubbing responses.
* **Visual Testing:**
    * Introduction to visual regression testing.
    * Using tools like Storybook and chromatic

**5.  Performance and Load Testing**

* **Performance Testing Fundamentals:**
    * Understanding performance metrics: response time, throughput, latency.
    * Performance testing types: load testing, stress testing, soak testing.
* **Load Testing with Locust (k6/Jmeter):**
    * Writing load test scenarios with Locust.
    * Simulating user load and analyzing performance bottlenecks.
    * Generating reports and identifying areas for optimization.

**6.  Security Testing**
* **Common Web Application Security Risks:**
    * OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws, broken authentication).
    * Cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    * Security best practices for APIs and web applications.
* **Security Testing Tools and Techniques:**
    * Using tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning.
    * Performing manual security testing.
    * Implementing security testing in the CI/CD pipeline.

**8.  Continuous Integration and Testing (CI/CT)**
* **Principles of CI/CT:**
    * Automating the build, test, and deployment process.
    * Benefits of CI/CT: early bug detection, faster feedback loops.
* **Setting up a CI/CT Pipeline:**
    * Using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
    * Integrating automated tests into the pipeline.
    * Implementing code coverage analysis and reporting.

**9.  Non-Functional Testing**
* **Usability Testing:**
    * Conducting usability testing sessions with real users.
    * Gathering feedback on the application's user-friendliness.
* **Accessibility Testing:**
    * Ensuring the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    * Using accessibility testing tools and following accessibility guidelines (WCAG).
