2.  You reduced manual data entry errors by 25% through EDI integration.  How did you measure the error rate before and after the integration?  What were the most common types of errors you encountered, and how did the EDI integration specifically address these errors?  Besides error reduction, what other benefits did the EDI integration bring?

3.  You state that the claims rejection rate decreased by 15% after implementing the rules engine. How did you ensure that this decrease was directly attributable to the rules engine, and not other factors? What specific types of rejections were reduced, and how were these rejections handled after the rules engine was implemented?

**GAP Inc.:**

**General (spanning multiple roles):**

1.  You've worked with different database technologies (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL). How do you approach choosing the right database for a specific project?  What factors do you consider when making this decision, and can you give examples of projects where you chose a particular database and why?

2.  Throughout your experience, you've worked on projects involving different scales of data and user traffic.  How have you adapted your development approach and technology choices based on the anticipated load and performance requirements of a system?  Can you give an example of a project where scalability was a key concern and how you addressed it?


# Social Media Application" project:
**Functionality and Features:**
1.  You mention "real-time interactions."  What technologies or techniques did you use to implement these real-time features?  Did you use WebSockets, server-sent events, or another approach? How did you handle scaling the real-time functionality to support a large number of concurrent users?

2.  Describe the architecture of the application. How did you structure the backend using the MERN stack? How did you handle data relationships between users, posts, comments, etc.?

3.  How did you implement the "secure login with JWT and Google OAuth"?  Walk me through the authentication flow and explain how you handled security considerations like protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

4.  You mentioned "efficient browsing with pagination and search." What specific strategies did you employ for pagination and search?  How did you optimize database queries to ensure fast retrieval of data, especially with a large number of posts and users?  Did you consider using any search indexing technologies like Elasticsearch?

**Technical Challenges and Decisions:**

1.  What were some of the biggest technical challenges you faced during the development of this social media application, and how did you overcome them?

2.  How did you approach testing this application? What types of tests did you write (unit, integration, end-to-end), and what tools did you use?
