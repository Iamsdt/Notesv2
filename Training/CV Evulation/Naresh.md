1. You've listed experience with both relational databases (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra). Can you describe a project where you chose a NoSQL database over a relational one, and explain the reasoning behind that decision? What were the advantages and disadvantages you encountered using each type of database?

2. You have experience with several cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure). How do you approach choosing the right cloud provider for a particular project, and what are some of the key factors you consider? Can you give specific examples of services you've used on each platform and why you chose those specific services?

3. You list both Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. How do these technologies complement each other in a microservices architecture? Can you describe a project where you utilized both and explain the specific roles each played?

4. You have experience with various messaging systems like Apache Kafka and JMS. In what situations would you choose Kafka over JMS, or vice versa? Can you discuss the trade-offs between these technologies in terms of performance, scalability, and reliability?

5. You mention experience with both REST and SOAP web services. What are the key differences between these two approaches, and when would you choose one over the other?  Have you ever worked on a project where you had to migrate from SOAP to REST, and what were the challenges involved in that process?

1.  You mention transforming the SmartPoll system into a microservices architecture. What were the main challenges you faced during this transformation, and how did you address them?  Were there any performance or integration issues you encountered when breaking down the monolithic application?

2. You created reusable UI components in Angular.  Can you give an example of a complex UI component you developed and explain the design decisions you made to ensure its reusability and maintainability across different parts of the application?

3.  You implemented CI/CD processes with Spinnaker. Can you describe the specific stages of your CI/CD pipeline and explain how Spinnaker facilitated the automation of these processes?  What metrics did you use to measure the effectiveness of your CI/CD implementation?

4. You improved scalability, security (using OAuth2), and data protection. Can you elaborate on the specific measures you implemented for each of these areas, and how did you test and validate their effectiveness within the production tracking systems?

5. You used a mix of PostgreSQL and MongoDB. What factors drove the decision to use both databases in this project? How did you manage data consistency and integrity between these two different database systems?
