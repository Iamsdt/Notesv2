1. You list Angular, Backbone, and jQuery under your front-end skills. These represent different generations of front-end frameworks.  Can you discuss your experience with each and explain when you might choose one over the others, considering factors like project size, complexity, and maintainability?

2.  You mention proficiency in TypeScript and JavaScript. How has adopting TypeScript impacted your front-end development workflow, and what are the key advantages you see in using TypeScript over plain JavaScript, especially in larger projects?

3.  You mention experience with both REST APIs and backend technologies like LINQ and ODOO.  Can you describe a project where you integrated front-end technologies like Angular with a backend API, and what were the key considerations for communication and data exchange between the two?

5. You've listed Apache, Nginx, and IIS. These are all web servers. What are the key differences between them, and in what situations would you choose one over the others? Have you ever had to configure these servers for specific front-end requirements, such as caching or SSL certificates?


# Work
### **3AmigosIT LLC, Remote**
1. You mention a 30% latency reduction by optimizing Angular integration. Can you elaborate on the specific strategies you employed to achieve this performance improvement?  What were the key bottlenecks you identified, and how did you address them?  What tools did you use to measure and track performance?

2. You implemented JWT-based SSO and role-based access control, achieving 99.9% uptime.  Walk me through the security considerations you took into account when designing and implementing this system, especially in the context of a healthcare application handling sensitive data. How did you ensure the security of the JWT tokens, and what measures were put in place for handling potential security breaches or unauthorized access attempts?

3.  In leading the development of this healthcare application, how did you balance the need for rapid development in an Agile environment with the stringent requirements and regulations often associated with the healthcare industry?  Can you give an example of a situation where you had to make a trade-off between speed and compliance, and how did you approach that decision?

# Project
1. **Quiz Generation System:**  How did you ensure the randomness of questions in your Quiz Generation System? Did you implement any mechanisms to prevent repeated questions or ensure a balanced distribution of question topics?  What considerations did you make regarding scalability if the number of users or questions increased significantly?

2. **Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection:**  You mention your fraud detection algorithm identifies 62.6% of fraudulent transactions while rejecting only 3% of legitimate ones.  What metrics did you use to evaluate the performance of your algorithm, besides the detection rate and rejection rate? How did you address the issue of imbalanced datasets, which are common in fraud detection scenarios? Can you explain the trade-off between identifying more fraudulent transactions and minimizing false positives?

3. **Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection:** What specific machine learning algorithms or techniques did you employ in your fraud detection project?  Explain the feature engineering process you used. How did you handle real-time data ingestion and processing for fraud detection?

4. **Centralization of Doctor Appointment Booking:**  What were the key challenges you faced in designing the database schema for the centralized doctor appointment booking system?  How did you ensure data integrity and consistency across the system, especially considering concurrent access by multiple users?

5. **Centralization of Doctor Appointment Booking (Hard):**  Describe the steps you took to optimize the performance of your SQL queries for the appointment booking system, especially considering a high volume of queries and data.  Did you use any indexing techniques or query optimization strategies? How did you handle database transactions and concurrency control to ensure data consistency in a multi-user environment?
