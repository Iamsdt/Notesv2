1.  You mention experience with AWS, Azure, and GCP.  Could you compare and contrast these cloud providers, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses for deploying Java microservices?

2.  Your CV lists several web technologies like JSP, Servlets, and Spring Boot.  How do these technologies relate to each other, and how have you used them together in a project?

3.  You include both Maven and Gradle as build tools. Can you explain the differences between these two tools and explain when you might prefer one over the other?

4.  You list Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes under DevOps & Tools.  Describe a typical CI/CD pipeline you've implemented using these tools, highlighting the role of each technology.

5. You have listed numerous front-end technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Angular14, Node.js, Bootstrap, TypeScript, React.js).  How do you stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving landscape of front-end development, and can you discuss a time you had to learn a new front-end technology quickly for a project?


# Certification

1. Your Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification demonstrates a foundational understanding of GCP. Can you describe a situation where your certification knowledge directly helped you solve a problem or implement a solution in a project, specifically related to compute, networking, or storage on GCP?

2.  The Associate Cloud Engineer certification emphasizes the importance of security best practices.  How did preparing for this certification enhance your understanding of security in the cloud, and how do you apply these principles in your daily work?

3.  Cost optimization is a key aspect of cloud management. How has your understanding of GCP pricing and cost management tools, gained through your certification preparation, influenced your decisions when designing and deploying applications on GCP?

4.  Automation is a core principle in cloud engineering.  Can you describe an example where you leveraged automation scripts or tools, drawing from your certification knowledge, to streamline a process or improve efficiency in a GCP project (e.g., deployment automation, infrastructure provisioning)?

5.  The Associate Cloud Engineer certification covers various GCP services.  Beyond those you've already mentioned (Cloud Run, Storage, Lambda, S3 - although Lambda and S3 are AWS, not GCP),  which GCP services are you most familiar with and how have you used them in practical applications? Can you describe a project where you had to choose between different GCP services for a particular task and explain your reasoning?
