## Project 1: Real-Time Log Analytics Platform

### Business Context
Develop a scalable log analytics platform capable of processing large-scale application logs, metrics, and user activity data in real-time. This platform will support both real-time streaming analytics and batch data processing, providing insights into application health, performance, and user behavior.

### Technical Requirements

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Use **Cloud Pub/Sub** for real-time message streaming from application logs and metrics.
   - Leverage the **Cloud Logging API** to capture system logs.
   
2. **Data Processing**:
   - **Real-Time Streaming**: Use **Apache Beam** via **Dataflow** to process streaming data from Pub/Sub and Cloud Logging in real-time.
   - **Batch Processing**: Implement **PySpark** on **Cloud Dataproc** to handle batch processing workloads, supporting data transformation, aggregation, and complex analytics.
   
3. **Data Storage**:
   - **BigQuery**: Store processed data for analytical querying and reporting.
   - **Cloud Storage**: Act as a data lake for raw and semi-processed data, ensuring durability and enabling reprocessing.
   - **Cloud Bigtable**: Provide low-latency access for real-time serving use cases, including dashboards and user-specific queries.
   
4. **Orchestration and Workflow Management**:
   - Use **Cloud Composer** (managed Airflow) to manage batch job scheduling, dependencies, and data pipeline orchestration.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** to track pipeline health, errors, and latency.

### Key Deliverables

#### 1. Streaming Data Pipeline
   - **Pipeline**: `Cloud Logging/Pub/Sub → Dataflow → BigQuery/Bigtable`
   - **Purpose**: Process log events, metrics, and user activity data in real-time, allowing immediate analysis and monitoring.
   - **Details**:
     - Dataflow jobs (based on Apache Beam) will process messages from Pub/Sub streams.
     - Logs and metrics will be filtered, transformed, and written to both BigQuery (for analysis) and Bigtable (for low-latency serving).

#### 2. Batch Data Pipeline
   - **Pipeline**: `Cloud Storage → Dataproc (PySpark) → BigQuery`
   - **Purpose**: Process historical data, perform aggregations, and build analytics datasets that support trend analysis and deep insights.
   - **Details**:
     - Raw data in Cloud Storage is processed in scheduled batch jobs using PySpark.
     - PySpark on Dataproc will handle ETL tasks such as reading raw logs, cleaning data, and performing aggregations.
     - Transformations include user-level aggregation, error rate analysis, and performance metrics computation.
     - Optimized data is saved in BigQuery for further analysis and reporting.

#### 3. Real-Time Dashboards
   - **Dashboards**:
     - **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track errors and anomalies in real-time.
     - **System Performance Metrics**: Monitor latency, request counts, CPU/memory usage.
     - **User Activity Patterns**: Visualize user actions and behavior.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Integrate Google Data Studio or Looker with BigQuery and Bigtable to build dashboards, ensuring data is updated in near-real-time from both the streaming and batch layers.

### Technical Details

1. **PySpark Usage in Batch Pipeline**:
   - **Job Configuration**: Configure PySpark jobs on Cloud Dataproc to process data in distributed fashion, handling large volumes efficiently.
   - **Transformations**: 
      - Use PySpark DataFrames for ETL: filter, group, and aggregate data.
      - Leverage SQL-like operations in PySpark to optimize data for BigQuery ingestion.
      - Data transformation steps include data cleanup (e.g., handling null values, standardizing formats), sessionization of user activity data, and error rate analysis.
   - **Output**: Write transformed data back to Cloud Storage in Parquet format, or load it directly into BigQuery using the BigQuery Connector for Apache Spark.

2. **Dataflow for Real-Time Processing**:
   - Use Apache Beam’s streaming mode in Dataflow to process logs and metrics from Pub/Sub.
   - **Streaming Transformations**:
     - Data is filtered, transformed, and enriched in real-time.
     - Relevant events are split based on type (e.g., error, info) and written to BigQuery for analytical querying.
     - For low-latency requirements, processed data is also stored in Bigtable for dashboard serving.

3. **BigQuery Storage Optimization**:
   - **Partitioning**: Partition tables in BigQuery by date or another time-based field to optimize query performance.
   - **Clustering**: Apply clustering on fields frequently used in queries (e.g., user ID or event type) to further reduce latency.
   - **Materialized Views**: Use materialized views for high-traffic queries to improve cost-efficiency and performance.

4. **Scheduling and Orchestration with Cloud Composer**:
   - Define workflows in Cloud Composer to automate and manage PySpark batch jobs.
   - Schedule PySpark jobs on Cloud Dataproc to run at regular intervals or based on triggers, such as data availability or specific time windows.
   - Implement error handling and retry logic to ensure robustness and maintain 99.9% pipeline availability.

5. **Monitoring and Cost Optimization**:
   - Use **Cloud Monitoring** and **Cloud Logging** to track job metrics (e.g., success/failure rates, processing times).
   - Set up alerts for failures or unusual latency in the pipelines.
   - **Cost Optimization**:
     - Use BigQuery cost control techniques, such as materialized views, partition pruning, and cluster filtering.
     - Optimize Dataproc jobs by using spot instances or custom machine types based on the workload.

### Success Metrics
To measure the success of the platform, track the following key metrics:

1. **Data Processing Throughput**: Ensure the pipeline can handle over 1 million events per minute with minimal latency.
2. **Query Latency**: Maintain query response times within 5 seconds for key metrics, including error rates and user activity.
3. **Pipeline Availability**: Ensure a 99.9% uptime for data ingestion and processing, supporting continuous data flow.
