### Problem: Knapsack with House Robber Constraints

#### Description:
You are a thief planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but **you cannot rob two adjacent houses**, as it would alert the police. Additionally, you have a bag with a limited capacity `C`, and each house also has a weight associated with it. You cannot rob houses if the total weight of the items you steal exceeds the capacity of your bag.

Given a list of houses where each house is represented by two values: 
- `money[i]`: the amount of money in the `i-th` house, and
- `weight[i]`: the weight of items in the `i-th` house, 

Find the maximum amount of money you can rob without exceeding the bag's capacity and without robbing two adjacent houses.

You are required to return the **maximum amount of money** you can rob.

#### Example:

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
money = [2, 3, 5, 7]
weight = [2, 3, 4, 5]
capacity = 6

Output:
7
```

**Explanation:**
- You cannot rob the 2nd and 3rd houses together.
- You can rob the 1st and 4th houses, or rob the 3rd house alone.
- The best option is to rob the 3rd house alone (money = 5), as the total weight of robbing 1st and 4th exceeds the capacity.

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
money = [3, 1, 4, 5, 2]
weight = [2, 1, 3, 4, 2]
capacity = 7

Output:
9
```

**Explanation:**
- You can rob the 1st, 3rd and last houses.
- Robbing both gives you 3 + 4 + 2 = 9, with a total weight of 2 + 3 + 2 = 7, which is within the capacity.

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= money.length == weight.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= money[i], weight[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= capacity <= 1000`

### Problem Breakdown:
This problem is a combination of the **House Robber problem** and the **Knapsack problem**.

- The **House Robber constraint** ensures that no two adjacent houses can be robbed.
- The **Knapsack constraint** ensures that the total weight of robbed houses doesn't exceed the given capacity.

### Approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a 2D DP array `dp[i][c]`, where `i` is the house index, and `c` is the capacity of the knapsack.
   - `dp[i][c]` represents the maximum amount of money you can rob from the first `i` houses with a bag capacity `c`.
   - For each house, you decide whether to rob it (taking into account the weight and money) or skip it (due to the house robber constraint and capacity).

Let me know if you'd like further details on the solution implementation or a specific approach to solve this!

Code:
```python
def knapsack_robber_recursive(money, weight, capacity):
    # Memoization dictionary to store already computed results
    memo = {}

    # Helper function to recursively calculate maximum money
    def rob_helper(i, remaining_capacity):
        # Base cases
        if i < 0 or remaining_capacity <= 0:
            return 0
        
        # If already calculated, return the memoized result
        if (i, remaining_capacity) in memo:
            return memo[(i, remaining_capacity)]
        
        # Option 1: Skip the current house
        max_money = rob_helper(i - 1, remaining_capacity)
        
        # Option 2: Rob the current house if the weight allows and skip the previous house
        if weight[i] <= remaining_capacity:
            max_money = max(max_money, money[i] + rob_helper(i - 2, remaining_capacity - weight[i]))
        
        # Store the result in memoization table
        memo[(i, remaining_capacity)] = max_money
        
        return max_money
    
    # Start the recursion with the last house and the given capacity
    return rob_helper(len(money) - 1, capacity)

# Example usage
money = [3, 1, 4, 5, 2]
weight = [2, 1, 3, 4, 2]
capacity = 7
print(knapsack_robber_recursive(money, weight, capacity))  # Output: 9
```
