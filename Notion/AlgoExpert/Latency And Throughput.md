Latency

The time it takes for a certain operation to complete in a system. Most often  
this measure is a time duration, like milliseconds or seconds. You should know  
these orders of magnitude:  

- Reading 1 MB from RAM: 250 μs (0.25 ms)
- Reading 1 MB from SSD: 1,000 μs (1 ms)
- Transfer 1 MB over Network: 10,000 μs (10 ms)
- Reading 1MB from HDD: 20,000 μs (20 ms)
- Inter-Continental Round Trip: 150,000 μs (150 ms)

  

  

Throughput:

The number of operations that a system can handle properly per time unit. For  
instance the throughput of a server can often be measured in requests per  
second (RPS or QPS).  

  

Latency refers to the time it takes for a specific operation to complete in a system. It is typically measured in units of time such as milliseconds or microseconds. Latency can vary depending on the type of operation and the components involved in the system. For example, reading 1 MB of data from RAM has a latency of 250 μs, while reading the same amount of data from an SSD takes 1,000 μs, and transferring it over a network takes 10,000 μs. The latency increases further when reading from an HDD or during an inter-continental round trip.

On the other hand, throughput measures the number of operations a system can handle effectively within a given time period. It is often expressed as requests per second (RPS) or queries per second (QPS) for servers. Throughput indicates the system's capacity to process and handle a certain workload.

In summary, latency focuses on the time it takes for individual operations to complete, while throughput measures the system's overall capability to handle a certain volume of operations within a specific time frame.
