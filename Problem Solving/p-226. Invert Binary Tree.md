Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

### Solution

Think about as block with left and right, swap left and right. Do it recursively

```Plain
import collections

class Solution:
    def invertTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root == None:
            return None

        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left

        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)

        return root
```
