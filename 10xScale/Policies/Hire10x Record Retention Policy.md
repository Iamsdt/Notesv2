#### **4. Record Retention Schedule**

The following table defines the minimum retention period for common record types. The retention period begins after the record's "creation" or "termination" event.

| Record Category                  | Record Examples                                                              | Retention Period                                  |

#### **5. Secure Destruction**

Once the retention period for a record has expired and it is not subject to a legal hold, it must be securely destroyed.
*   **Electronic Records:** Will be permanently deleted or cryptographically erased in a manner that ensures they cannot be practicably recovered. This is managed through automated scripts for customer data and formal deletion processes for other records.
*   **Physical Records:** Will be securely shredded or otherwise physically destroyed by a certified third-party vendor. A Certificate of Destruction will be obtained as proof of disposal.

This process is governed by the principles laid out in our **Asset Disposal and Media Sanitization Policy**.

#### **6. Legal Holds**

In the event that Hire10x is involved in or anticipates litigation, an audit, or a government investigation, the **Security Officer** or **Executive Management** may issue a "Legal Hold" notice. Upon receipt of this notice, the normal retention schedule and any associated destruction procedures are immediately suspended for all records relevant to the hold. These records must be preserved until the legal hold is formally lifted.

#### **7. Policy Review**

This Record Retention Policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure it remains current with changing legal, regulatory, and business requirements.
