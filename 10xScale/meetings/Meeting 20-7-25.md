Talked about Branding

 ##### **Considerations for Branding:**
1. **Creates a deep and lasting impression**
2. **Helps build an emotional connection with users**
3. **Should allow us to build a brand narrative** (purpose, values, personality)
4. **The brand name should clearly relate to what we offer**
5. **Shouldn't limit us to our current scope** — we should be able to expand and pivot
6. **Should build trust with all stakeholders** — partners, clients, agencies, employees, etc.
7. **Should support internal and external consistency and adoption**
8. **Brand Architecture** — have one master brand (anchor/parent), and sub-brands for products/services
9. **Marketability is crucial** — get an agency to help design the visual identity and check how feasible it is to bring it to life

### **Examples of using the brand:**

1. **Parent Brand Name**:    
    - Options like **Summitly.ai** or **Summitly AI Labs**.

2. **Product Branding Approaches:**
    **a. Individual Branding**
    - E.g., “**Hire10X from Summitly**” or “**Talent-Pursuit from Summitly**”
    - This gives products their own identity but still links them to the parent brand.
    
    **b. Integrated Branding**
    - E.g., “**Pursuit-Summitly**, Train-Summitly, Transform-Summitly”
    - Tightly coupled with the parent brand (good for unified identity).
    
    **c. Suite Branding**
    - Present as "**Summitly.ai suite**" with each product seen as a capability inside it.    
    **d. Open to Other Options**    
    - Mentions there could be other flexible naming/branding strategies.

Summary:
Naveen Thogati explained that their primary goal is to help candidates clear interviews and get selected. Naveen Thogati stated that he received feedback from the previous week that the product is good with room for improvement, and mentioned that their team is helping and spending a lot of time on it. Naveen Thogati emphasized the difficulty of onboarding multiple vendors outside their ecosystem due to the lack of integration with job portals like Dice, Monster, or CareerBuilder, which is a significant disadvantage unless their positioning is different, and suggested focusing on building portal capability, infusing quick funding, and integrating with Monster and CareerBuilder to propose more licenses and build partnerships.

Naveen Thogati expressed confusion and frustration regarding DICE's reluctance to integrate, despite repeated requests from Roha and others, with shiva confirming that DICE has consistently stated they have no integration plan at the moment. Naveen Thogati suggested threatening DICE with partnership termination, but shiva proposed focusing on current integrations with Monster and CareerBuilder and revisiting DICE later, while Naveen Thogati urged the team to continuously think about how to make their platform more compelling and develop a plan B to survive without these integrations by providing the same or more value independently.

Naveen Thogati explained that while they have approval from Monster and CareerBuilder, a very specific terminology was used, which needs clarification before integration, incurring a cost of $12,000 to $15,000. He emphasized the importance of building capabilities around Monster and CareerBuilder to eventually make Dice, currently the market leader, unnecessary for their operations. Naveen Thogati also informed Janardhan Nagaraj and Shiva about the significant consolidation happening in the job search market, with Monster acquiring CareerBuilder, and both being acquired by a non-IT focused company, making it crucial for them to integrate into this consolidating ecosystem.

Janardhan Nagaraj discussed the exploratory research he conducted on positioning their brand for individuals with basic experience, such as trainees or those in starter jobs. He mentioned that a brand, like a product, is an asset that signifies and amplifies their work when engaging with investors, other consultancies, and platforms like D Monster career builder. Janardhan Nagaraj further explained that the brand should create an emotional connection, making individuals feel safe and confident that the company can help them achieve meaningful career progress.

Janardhan Nagaraj emphasized that the brand narrative or storyline should be easily replicable across various content and channels, including internal and external content, product pages, blogs, and social media. He discussed brand architecture, highlighting the pros and cons of a unified approach where everything relates to a master brand, noting the risk of a single product's issues impacting the entire brand. Naveen Thogati explained that the goal is to break away from the negative perception associated with "trainex" and create a more dignified brand that attracts serious individuals, and he also questioned how to brand themselves to avoid being typecast into a typical training context.

Janardhan Nagaraj discussed "Summitly" as a potential name for their organization, explaining that it resonates with their target audience of budding professionals by symbolizing growth and climbing the corporate ladder. He added that the name is not limiting to specific products, like "higher 10x," allowing for scalability and applicability to social outreach ideas such as hackathons. Janardhan Nagaraj also mentioned the need to secure a domain, suggesting "summitly.ai" might be available, and considered positioning themselves as an "AI labs" to emphasize their AI-first approach, while also discussing the pros and cons of having a master brand and sub-brands versus disjointing the core brand from individual product names.

Janardhan Nagaraj discussed two brand options: one for integrated branding, and another for diverse segments, explaining the advantages of each. Naveen Thogati clarified that the current discussion is not about immediate changes, but rather a strategic repositioning of the company to be more appealing and generic, moving away from explicit connotations of training or hiring. Janardhan Nagaraj further elaborated on the importance of defining a brand voice that resonates with various personas, such as recruiters, trainees, and consultancy owners, and suggested testing different brand voices with investors and during training sessions to gauge their effectiveness.

Janardhan Nagaraj suggested developing two or three options for brand evolution, including creative concepts, narratives, and potential logo designs, to explore how the brand translates across different marketing channels before finalizing a direction. Shiva emphasized the need for better product naming, especially considering the upcoming pivot point in October, but expressed concern about changing the parent brand name, "10x CAVE," due to existing branding efforts on social media. Naveen Thogati reassured that renaming is manageable, even for large organizations, and stressed the importance of creating a rebranding that is more "branding friendly" and possesses good call value.

Naveen Thogati explained that the terms "hiring" and "training" have negative connotations in the IT industry, especially in India, and it would be challenging to compete with the low-cost training institutes already present in the market. He suggested exploring alternative names like "summitly.ai" that better reflect their unique value proposition of providing high-quality training and helping individuals reach the "summit" of their careers, while shiva agreed with the idea of a new name to distinguish their product. Shudipto Trafder confirmed that summitly.ai and summitly.e are available, but summitly.com is a premium domain that costs 12 lakh Indian rupees.

Naveen Thogati indicated that summitly.ai would be a good option for their AI-based company, noting that the cost of 4 lakh Indian rupees for the main domain was not excessive and that they could acquire it later. Shudipto Trafder clarified that the listed price for the domain was direct and did not involve broker fees, unlike other domains. Janardhan Nagaraj and Shudipto Trafder confirmed that summitly.io is an existing e-commerce growth partner and community connector, but Naveen Thogati stated that they could start with summitly.ai and explore summitly.com later, as the domains were different and not competing.

Shudipto Trafder demonstrated the current inbox option, which displays conversations from different channels in separate threads, and highlighted that the email tab has two options, one of which is "10xbox" for first-party data. Naveen Thogati clarified that the main question is whether to replicate the entire LinkedIn inbox or only conversations relevant to the platform. Janardhan Nagaraj explained that while integrating the entire LinkedIn inbox could offer a single user interface, there's little value in bringing in non-recruiting-related conversations due to scope and consent concerns. He proposed a toggle option to allow users to fetch their complete LinkedIn inbox, possibly constrained by time, with a default view of first-party conversations.

Shudipto Trafder raised a concern about data storage, particularly regarding LinkedIn data, asking whether it should be downloaded or directly used. Shiva mentioned that LinkedIn doesn't prevent scraping public data and suggested that data could be fetched via API each time a user accesses a particular section, similar to a previous implementation for "emotional" data. Naveen Thogati supported this, emphasizing that continuous saving and updating wouldn't be necessary, and that real-time data would still require a final connection and refresh before display.

Naveen Thogati asked about the UI, suggesting that building a UI on top of LinkedIn to fit their system would be an easier problem to solve. Shudipto Trafder mentioned that they are working on WhatsApp integration, with two options: WhatsApp personal, which opens in a new tab without API connection or cost, and WhatsApp business, which uses an API and receives replies via webhooks, with automation types including manual and AI-powered replies. Naveen Thogati also inquired about the resume builder and the role of AI in it, to which shiva explained that AI helps make resumes more suitable for job descriptions by adjusting language for better ATS screening, and Shudipto Trafder confirmed they use large language models like OpenAI GPT-4 and Gemini.

Naveen Thogati discussed using KNN for soft BGV to establish candidate authenticity, citing it as a major industry problem and a key sales pitch for weeding out fake profiles. He also highlighted the importance of integrating with BGV companies like Monster and Carrier Builder to streamline the background verification process for candidates. Additionally, Naveen Thogati asked Janardhan Nagaraj about a website for I94 validation to potentially automate the process, to which Janardhan Nagaraj mentioned it's from DHS and he would share the link, noting that terms of service would need to be reviewed for API availability.

Naveen Thogati emphasized the importance of automating tasks to avoid human error and streamline processes, especially concerning background verification (BGV). Janardhan Nagaraj agreed, noting that even short tasks can create significant overhead in terms of handoffs and system switches. Janardhan Nagaraj then proposed that Shiva and Sudipto begin by outlining the key components of a soft BGV process to map out process elements and consider the scope of models needed, which Naveen Thogati anticipated would take one to two years to fully mature.

Janardhan Nagaraj explained that they can verify employer relationships on LinkedIn and infer the depth of these relationships, which could evolve into a micro-model. Naveen Thogati emphasized that employers prioritize genuine profiles, as fake profiles are unacceptable, citing that a single full-time position can attract thousands of applications, making effective shortlisting crucial. Naveen Thogati also suggested building a financial model once vendors are confident in their service, which combines automation with a human workforce for tasks that cannot be fully automated, and Janardhan Nagaraj added that this model could evolve to use AI and rules engines in tandem, with human intervention for inconclusive decisions as a premium service.

Naveen Thogati emphasized the long-term vision of developing their own AI model specifically trained for resume building and BGV, asserting that relying solely on existing generic models would only scratch the surface of the problem. Shudipto Trafder added that their resume builder currently uses 12 templates, with more being added, and includes an AI chatbot option, noting ongoing improvements. Janardhan Nagaraj and Naveen Thogati discussed the challenges faced by applicants in a "dangerous demography" of 45+ year old Indian males in Phoenix who are in a midlife career crisis, with Naveen Thogati noting that the market is primed for architecture roles, and applying as an architect or enterprise architect yields calls.

Naveen Thogati discussed career opportunities, noting that while leadership roles in architecture are available, positions like delivery leader or strategy transformation leader are less common for their demographic. Naveen Thogati then challenged shiva to help secure a call for a VP or senior director role within two weeks, offering to provide access to their work and conduct an interview. Naveen Thogati also shared information about a colleague, a double PhD in quantum from IIT Kolkata, who successfully recreated a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model using quantum technology, which will be published as a white paper. Naveen Thogati emphasized the importance of considering quantum-safe security measures, suggesting that companies explore quantum-safe programming and digital certificates to gain a first-mover advantage as technology progresses.

Latest update

Naveen Thogati emphasized the importance of their base product and achieving a first-mover advantage from a technology standpoint, noting his previous unawareness of a team member's extensive work in quantum computing until an expense approval for an I3 conference. Later, the discussion shifted to Shudipto Trafder's post-marriage trip, with shiva confirming that 10X Scale would sponsor the trip, contingent on Shudipto Trafder creating a joint account. Towards the end of the meeting, Shudipto Trafder presented a dashboard he created, explaining its features for filtering data by date, showing token usage for prompt, output, and total tokens, and detailing how different services, particularly summary generation, utilize AI tokens.
