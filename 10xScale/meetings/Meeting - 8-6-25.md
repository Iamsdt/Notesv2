# Date: 8/6/25
Course: Java Full-Stack including GEN-AI/Big Data (Include pyspark, beam, flink, airflow)
Duration: 3 months
2 Case Study: Banking Architecture + Other sector

Main Course
1. Build micro-service and deploy using ci/cd

Current Industry follow this major challenge
Legacy Database -> main frame db2, ims, sql servers, oracal data (more than 10 years)

Now we need to migrate to cloud (aws/gcp/azure), Mongo-db/posgresql
For GCP -> Big-query
Source Database to target database

Steps:
1. Understand current database (most of the time entity no clear)
2. Poa (Point of arival). Analysts to understand what data is used (that's why you need to understand java and python pyspark)
3. Then put the data to big-query (Understand the big query)

Source Database: Postgres
Migration Database: Bigquery

During course in 1 Week cover these topics:
1. AI concept
2. AL Algo
3. Big Data
4. ML not required ->
5. Gen AI -> only prompt engineering

Class Schedule - Every day:
1. 15 mins for interview preparation
2. 3 Class (per class 2 hours)
3. Leet-code (Mandatory)

Class 5 days a week

Required Practical Hands on 
1. CI/CD, Github Actions (Monorepo vs Multi Repo)
2. Peer Review + (AI Review)
3. Performance Engineering (Machine Log and Human Logs)


Code Review:
1. Style/docs
2. cycling error
3. performance error (domain level/performance)


Project Idea:
Multi-model Review Agent, Multiple Model Can review the code and aggregate,
and performance identify ....
