✅ GitHub project board setup  
✅ Sprint planning & issue assignments

**Project Milestones:**

- Base Spring Boot services scaffolded (user, auth, API)
    
- React app initialized (routing, basic components)
    
- Initial database models designed
    
- AI integration plan drafted (e.g., prompt engineering for code analysis, OpenAI API stub)
    

**Interview Prep:**

- System Design: REST API best practices, scaling fundamentals
    
- DSA Refresh: Arrays, Strings, Hashing (discussion format, not tutorial)
    

**Saturday Deep Dive:**

- Review progress & blockers
    
- Build vs Buy: Discussing AI APIs and integrations
    
- Code quality, testing strategies
