# Database Optimization:

## **1. Compute & Scalability**

### **Current Setup:**
- ECS on a **single EC2 micro instance** (free-tier) or Fargate if needed.
- Auto-scaling policies enabled at Week 5.

### **Improvements:**
✅ **Move from Single EC2 to Fargate for Better Scaling**
- EC2 micro instances have CPU burst limits; **Fargate (pay-per-use)** eliminates this constraint.
- Offloads server management, enabling horizontal scaling based on CPU/memory utilization.

✅ **Leverage Graviton2-Based Instances (cheaper & faster)**
- If EC2 is preferred, **Graviton2 (ARM-based) instances** provide ~20% better price-performance.

✅ **Consider Serverless for Intermittent Workloads**
- Some workloads (e.g., cron jobs, background processing) can move to **Lambda** instead of always-on ECS tasks.

---
## **2. Database Optimization**
### **Current Setup:**
- **Single-AZ RDS t3.micro**, free-tier, backups enabled.
### **Improvements:**
✅ **Enable Multi-AZ RDS for High Availability**
- Current setup lacks redundancy. If the DB fails, the entire system goes down.
- Multi-AZ ensures automatic failover (costs ~2x, but worth it for production).

✅ **Use Read Replicas for Scaling Reads**
- Helps distribute read traffic across multiple DB instances.
- Good for high-read workloads like analytics or reporting.

✅ **Explore Aurora Serverless for Cost Optimization**
- Automatically scales **down to $0 when idle**, making it **better than RDS t3.micro** for sporadic workloads.

✅ **Implement Connection Pooling via RDS Proxy**
- Prevents DB overload from too many connections (especially useful for serverless workloads).

## **3. Networking & Traffic Optimization**

### **Current Setup:**
- **ALB (750 free hours)** for ECS.
- **CloudFront CDN** for frontend assets (1TB free).
- **No NAT Gateway** (saves $32/month).

### **Improvements:**
✅ **Enable AWS Global Accelerator for Lower Latency (Optional)**
- Routes users to the **nearest AWS edge location**, reducing request latency.
- Costs ~$18/month, but can significantly improve international performance.

✅ **Optimize CloudFront with Better Caching & Compression**
- Use **CloudFront Functions** to redirect static requests and improve cache hit ratio.
- **Enable Brotli compression** for better performance (~30% smaller responses than Gzip).

✅ **Use AWS PrivateLink to Reduce Data Transfer Costs**
- Internal AWS services (ECS ↔ RDS) should use **PrivateLink** to avoid expensive public data transfer costs.

✅ **Replace ALB with API Gateway for Fully Serverless Apps**
- If moving toward Lambda, **API Gateway** is cheaper than maintaining an ALB (~$16/month).

## **5. Monitoring & Observability**

### **Current Setup:**

- **CloudWatch for logs, alarms, and basic metrics.**
- **Budget alerts to prevent cost overruns.**

### **Improvements:**
✅ **Enable AWS X-Ray for Tracing Requests Across Services**
- Helps **debug latency issues** by tracing requests across **ECS, RDS, ALB, and CloudFront**.

✅ **Use Prometheus & Grafana for Better Metrics (via AWS Managed Service)**
- Provides **more detailed insights** than CloudWatch metrics, especially for containerized workloads.

✅ **Enable AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**

- Automatically alerts if AWS costs spike unexpectedly.

## **6. Cost Optimization Strategies**

### **Current Setup:**
- Uses **AWS free-tier** effectively in the first year.
- Auto-scaling and cost monitoring set up by Week 5.

### **Improvements:**
✅ **Use Spot Instances for Non-Critical Workloads**
- **Savings of ~70%** compared to on-demand instances.
- Use for batch jobs, dev/test environments, or horizontally scalable ECS tasks.

✅ **Leverage Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for Long-Term Cost Reduction**
- For **stable workloads** (e.g., RDS, baseline ECS), reserve capacity to cut **costs by ~30–40%**.

✅ **Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering for Cost-Effective Storage**
- Moves **infrequently accessed data** to lower-cost storage **without manual intervention**.

✅ **Use Lambda@Edge for Lightweight API Processing**
- Move simple API endpoints to **CloudFront Lambda@Edge**, reducing backend traffic and response time.
