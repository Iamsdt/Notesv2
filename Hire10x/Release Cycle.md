_Release Process:_

1. **Merge Deadline:**
    - All pull requests (PRs) and code changes must be merged into the main branch before the start of the stand up meeting.
2. **Standup Meeting:**
    - After the standup meeting, the tester will begin testing the merged code.
3. **Testing:**
    - The tester will thoroughly test the merged code.
    - Upon completion of testing and verification, the code will be moved to production.

_Pull Request Guidelines:_

1. **Approval Requirements:**
    - Each pull request requires two approvals.
    - The first approval must be from a peer developer.
2. **Code Review:**
    - Peer developers should conduct thorough code reviews to ensure quality, scalability, readability, and maintainability.
    - Address any feedback or issues raised during the code review process before merging.
3. **Documentation:**
    - Ensure that all changes are appropriately documented, including any new features, changes, or bug fixes.
4. **Testing Checklist:**
    - Before submitting a pull request, ensure that the code passes all relevant tests.
    - Include any necessary unit tests or integration tests with the code changes.
5. **Merge Deadline:**
