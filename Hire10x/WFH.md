## Executive Summary

This policy establishes the mandatory standards for employee work, leave, and performance at Hire10x. It defines official working hours (10:00 AM to 7:00 PM), including mandatory Saturday sessions for sprint completion, and provides a 12-day annual leave policy with carry-forward limits. Performance serves as the primary evaluation metric, directly influencing rewards such as Work From Home privileges, bonuses, and sprint-based incentives, as well as penalties for non-compliance. The policy also mandates 24/7 availability for the Customer Priority Response Team (CPRT) and enforces strict policy adherence across all employees.

## 12. Performance, Evaluation, Rewards & Penalties

### 12.1. Core Principle of Evaluation
Performance is the single most critical metric for evaluation. All decisions regarding rewards, penalties, WFH privileges, and career progression will be based on performance. Performance is calculated based on the successful and timely completion of tasks outlined in the sprint plan.

### 12.2. Rewards
All rewards are granted based on measurable high performance.

**Work From Home (WFH):** WFH is a privilege, not a right. It is granted as a reward for sustained, exceptional performance and requires explicit management approval. Employees approved for WFH must maintain availability during office hours, attend all meetings, and ensure stable internet connectivity and a professional work environment. This privilege can be revoked at any time based on performance dips or business needs.

**Fixing Customer P1 Bugs:** Members of the Customer Priority Response Team (CPRT) who successfully and timely resolve P1 bugs will be rewarded.

**Sprint and Performance Rewards:**
- **Sprint Hero:** Awarded weekly to the top 3 performers in the sprint.
- **Spotlight Star:** Awarded monthly to the top 3 most consistent high performers. This reward includes a combination of gifts, vouchers, or other incentives as determined by management.

### 12.3. Penalties & Performance Management

- **Penalty - P1 Bugs:** Failure to solve assigned Customer P1 bugs within the defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) will result in financial or other penalties.

- **Lack of Team Collaboration:** Willfully obstructing team progress or failing to collaborate effectively is a performance violation.

- **Poor Communication:** Failure to provide clear, timely, and professional communication to team members and management will be penalized. Employees are expected to acknowledge internal communication (emails, WhatsApp, or calls) within a reasonable timeframe during working hours.

- **Unprofessional Conduct:** Employees are expected to maintain professional behavior and adhere to ethical standards while representing the company. Harassment, discrimination, or disrespectful behavior toward colleagues or clients will lead to disciplinary action.

- **Casual/Negligent Behavior:** Purposefully casual behavior, negligence, or a demonstrable lack of seriousness toward assigned work will not be tolerated and will be subject to disciplinary action.

- **Underperformance (Less than 100%):** Any employee completing less than 100% of their assigned tasks in a sprint will have a mandatory performance call with management.

- **Serious Red Flag:** Consistent underperformance is a serious red flag. It demonstrates an inability to meet the job requirements and will lead to formal disciplinary procedures, up to and including termination of employment.
