# 10xScale Future Infrastructure Requirements
1.  **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):**  GKE will be leveraged for both products to provide scalable application hosting and robust microservice management, including streamlined CI/CD pipelines.

2.  **Cloud Load Balancing:**  To comply with GDPR and other regional data sovereignty regulations, and to optimize performance for users in diverse geographic locations (e.g., USA, India, UK), Cloud Load Balancing will be implemented.  Specifically:
    *   **Hire10x:**  Data residency requirements will be addressed through geographically distributed deployments.
    *   **Training10x:**  As our training facilities expand to the USA, India, and other regions, Cloud Load Balancing will ensure optimal user experience.  This strategy will also support global access to other product offerings, such as resume builders and AI interview tools.

3.  **Cloud Armor:** Cloud Armor will be deployed to provide comprehensive protection against Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ensuring application availability and security.

4.  **Cloud GPUs:** Cloud GPUs will be utilized to build and deploy our proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs).

5.  **Google Vertex AI:**
    *   **Model Selection:** Open-source LLMs, such as Llama and DeepSeek, will be evaluated and potentially integrated as base models.
    *   **Fine-Tuning:** Vertex AI will be used to fine-tune selected open-source models, including Llama, DeepSeek, and models from Hugging Face, to optimize performance for specific use cases.
    *   **Custom Model Deployment:** Fine-tuned custom models will be deployed via Vertex AI for efficient and scalable inference.
