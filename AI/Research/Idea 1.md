### **Research Proposal: Evaluating Multilingual Prompt Engineering for News Classification, Question Answering, and Summarization in English and Bengali**

---

#### **1. Introduction and Background**

Prompt engineering has become a central technique for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various NLP tasks. While many studies have explored prompt design in high-resource languages like English, there remains a significant research gap regarding prompt effectiveness in low-resource languages, including Bengali. Given the unique syntactic and semantic features of Bengali, as well as the cultural differences that impact natural language understanding, it is crucial to investigate how well LLMs can handle multilingual tasks through prompt engineering.

This study will focus on evaluating the effectiveness of prompt engineering for three tasks across English and Bengali: **news category classification, question answering, and summarization**. These tasks are practical and high-impact, relevant to real-world applications like content filtering, information retrieval, and content summarization in both English-speaking and Bengali-speaking communities.

#### **2. Research Objectives**

1. **To evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering for news category classification, question answering, and summarization in English and Bengali.**
2. **To analyze the cross-linguistic performance of prompts** across English and Bengali, identifying areas where language-specific nuances may impact task accuracy.
3. **To establish best practices for multilingual prompt engineering** in low-resource languages by examining performance consistency across tasks.
4. **To understand the limitations and challenges** faced by current language models when dealing with low-resource languages like Bengali.

#### **3. Research Questions**

1. **How effectively do prompts designed for English translate to Bengali for each task?**
2. **Does the accuracy of prompt responses differ between English and Bengali** in news category classification, question answering, and summarization?
3. **What specific challenges arise in Bengali prompt engineering**, and what adaptations can improve performance?
4. **Are there unique cultural or linguistic factors in Bengali** that influence LLM performance compared to English?

#### **4. Methodology**

##### **4.1 Task Selection and Dataset Design**

**Tasks and Dataset Requirements**:
   - **News Category Classification**: Classify news articles into predetermined categories, e.g., politics, sports, technology, health, etc.
     - **Dataset Size**: 1,000 prompt-response pairs per language (English and Bengali).
   - **Question Answering**: Develop prompts that ask specific questions about short passages or sentences, with accurate answers provided by the model.
     - **Dataset Size**: 500 prompt-response pairs per language.
   - **Summarization**: Summarize news articles or short texts in a concise manner.
     - **Dataset Size**: 300 prompt-response pairs per language.

**Data Collection and Annotation**:
   - **News Classification**: Curate articles from public datasets like BBC News (for English) and Anandabazar Patrika (for Bengali) across predefined categories. Annotate each article for its category and ensure category consistency across languages.
   - **Question Answering**: Select or create short passages in English and Bengali with clear, direct questions. Manually verify answers for accuracy.
   - **Summarization**: Extract or translate articles for summarization, ensuring summaries are accurate, concise, and retain essential information.

##### **4.2 Prompt Design and Translation**

1. **English Prompt Design**: Create initial prompts in English for each task, ensuring that prompts are clear, context-appropriate, and align with each task’s requirements.
2. **Bengali Prompt Design and Adaptation**: Translate prompts to Bengali with the assistance of native speakers. Adjust prompts as needed to account for cultural and linguistic differences, ensuring prompts retain the same meaning and intent as their English counterparts.

##### **4.3 Evaluation Framework**

1. **Automatic Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Classification**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate news category predictions.
   - **Question Answering**: Use BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR scores to measure the similarity between predicted and reference answers.
   - **Summarization**: Use ROUGE and BERTScore to assess the quality and relevance of summaries produced by the model.

2. **Human Evaluation**:
   - **Native Speaker Judgments**: Engage native speakers to evaluate Bengali responses, scoring them for relevance, fluency, and cultural appropriateness on a 1-5 scale.
   - **Cross-Linguistic Consistency**: Rate each Bengali response’s consistency with the English response to assess alignment across languages.

##### **4.4 Error Analysis**

1. **Error Categorization**: Manually analyze incorrect responses to identify common patterns in misclassification, inaccurate answers, or incomplete summaries.
2. **Cross-Language Analysis**: Compare errors in English and Bengali prompts to identify language-specific issues or performance gaps.

#### **5. Expected Outcomes**

1. **Performance Benchmarks for English and Bengali Prompt Engineering**: Comprehensive metrics that quantify prompt performance across both languages, with insights into each task's challenges.
2. **Cross-Linguistic Insights and Adaptations**: Identification of linguistic nuances or prompt adaptations needed to improve Bengali prompt effectiveness.
3. **Guidelines for Multilingual Prompt Engineering**: A set of best practices for designing prompts that work effectively in both high-resource and low-resource languages.

#### **6. Potential Contributions and Impact**

   - **Enhanced Multilingual Model Usability**: This study will provide insights that improve LLM usability for Bengali, a low-resource language, expanding accessibility for Bengali-speaking communities.
   - **Guidelines for Low-Resource Language Prompt Engineering**: The research could inform best practices for researchers and developers working in multilingual NLP, particularly in low-resource settings.
   - **Cross-Cultural Evaluation in Prompt Engineering**: By comparing English and Bengali, this research will contribute to understanding the role of cultural context in multilingual NLP tasks.
