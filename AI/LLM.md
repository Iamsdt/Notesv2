## Summary

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open, vendor-agnostic standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) to external data sources and tools, much like a “USB-C port” for AI applications . Developed and open-sourced by Anthropic in late 2024—and now supported by major players including OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft—MCP addresses the fragmentation and scaling challenges of one-off function calls . Unlike traditional function calling, which is stateless, linear, and tightly coupled, MCP provides a bi-directional, client-server framework that standardizes tool discovery, execution, and context management across any AI system . This enables stateful workflows, dynamic tool orchestration, and multi-agent coordination—paving the way for more autonomous, context-aware AI agents.

## What Is MCP?

- **Open Protocol for Context**  
    MCP is an open standard that defines how applications provide context to LLMs, allowing AI models to plug into a wide array of data sources and tools in a uniform way .
    
- **Client-Server Architecture**  
    At its core, MCP follows a client-server model: host applications (e.g., Claude Desktop, IDEs) include an MCP client that connects to one or more MCP servers, which in turn expose specific resources or capabilities—ranging from databases and file systems to web APIs—over standardized transports like STDIO or HTTP+SSE .
    
- **Vendor-Agnostic and Extensible**  
    Originally introduced by Anthropic to power Claude’s “Work with Apps,” MCP is now supported in the OpenAI Agents SDK and by community projects on GitHub, making it easy to switch between LLM providers or add custom integrations without rewriting core logic .
    

## Why MCP Is Important

- **Solves the NxM Integration Problem**  
    With countless AI models (N) and an even larger number of tools (M), bespoke integrations quickly become unmanageable. MCP provides a single, universal protocol that eliminates redundant engineering and reduces maintenance overhead .
    
- **Accelerates Agentic AI Development**  
    By standardizing tool discovery and execution, MCP empowers developers to construct sophisticated, multi-step agent workflows—such as AI-powered IDE assistants or autonomous data pipelines—without juggling disparate APIs .
    
- **Enhances Security and Collaboration**  
    As an open protocol, MCP encourages best practices around authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.1 with PKCE) and human-in-the-loop permission prompts, while fostering a community-driven ecosystem of pre-built servers for platforms like GitHub, Slack, and PostgreSQL .
    
- **Industry Adoption and Ecosystem Growth**  
    Hundreds of MCP servers have already been published—ranging from enterprise connectors to community contributions—backed by companies such as Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph, which underscores MCP’s momentum as the de-facto standard for AI context integration .
    

## How MCP Differs from Function Calling

### Function Calling

- **Definition**  
    Function calling enables LLMs to identify when to invoke predefined functions and generates structured JSON to call them, rather than returning unstructured text ([Everything about AI Function Calling and MCP, the keyword for Agentic AI - DEV Community](https://dev.to/samchon/everything-about-ai-function-calling-mcp-the-keyword-for-agentic-ai-2id7)).
    
- **Characteristics**
    
    - **Stateless & One-Off:** Each invocation is a standalone request, with no built-in memory of past calls .
        
    - **Predefined Tools:** Available functions must be declared upfront in model-specific schemas, and handlers are tightly coupled to each LLM vendor’s API ([Everything about AI Function Calling and MCP, the keyword for Agentic AI - DEV Community](https://dev.to/samchon/everything-about-ai-function-calling-mcp-the-keyword-for-agentic-ai-2id7)).
        
    - **Linear Execution:** Lacks native support for dynamic discovery or coordination across multiple tools; each call occurs in isolation .
        
    - **Vendor-Specific:** You often need different schema definitions and implementations for each LLM provider you support .
        

### Model Context Protocol

- **Stateful Context Management**  
    MCP sessions retain context across calls, enabling AI agents to “remember” previous interactions—essential for long-running workflows and multi-step orchestration .
    
- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**  
    MCP clients query servers at runtime to discover available capabilities, eliminating the need to hardcode function schemas for each model or tool .
    
- **Client-Server Modularity**  
    By abstracting tool execution into standalone MCP servers, MCP decouples business logic from client applications, fostering true modularity and reusability .
    
- **Multi-Agent & Resource Handling**  
    MCP builds in support for orchestrating multiple LLM agents, sampling-based communications, and complex resource workflows (e.g., combining database reads, file operations, and API calls) without bespoke glue code .
    
- **Universal Integration**  
    Just as USB-C delivers power and data across devices, MCP provides a “universal remote” that works with any AI application and any tool implementing the protocol—regardless of the underlying LLM vendor .
    

## Conclusion

MCP represents a paradigm shift in AI integration: moving from isolated, stateless function calls toward a standardized, stateful, and modular architecture that empowers developers to build richer, more autonomous AI agents. By bridging LLMs with the vast ecosystem of data sources and tools through a single open protocol, MCP not only simplifies engineering but also unlocks new possibilities for context-aware, scalable AI applications.
