### React App Deployment
When building a React application, the output consists of static files (HTML, CSS, JS). These files can be served directly by a web server like Nginx. Here’s an Nginx configuration for serving a React app:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html/apps/host;
        index index.html;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

In this setup:
- The web server serves static files directly.
- No additional server process is required to handle requests.

### Next.js Deployment
Next.js, in contrast, requires a server to handle server-side rendering (SSR). This server runs on a specified port (e.g., 3000). Here’s an Nginx configuration for proxying requests to a Next.js server:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

In this setup:
- Nginx proxies requests to a running Next.js server.
- A dedicated server process is required to handle requests.


I was talking about this server which is running at port 3000. In the React case, it just sends whatever files are requested; dedicated server not required.

For a React app, a dedicated server running on a specific port is not required because Nginx or any other web server can serve the static files directly. This is unlike Next.js, which requires a server to handle SSR, running on a port like 3000 and proxied through Nginx. This difference allows React apps to be hosted on cloud storage solutions like AWS S3, using a CDN for scalable delivery without a dedicated server.
