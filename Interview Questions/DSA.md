1. **Explain the difference between an array and a linked list.**

**Answer:**

- **Array:**
    - Contiguous block of memory.
    - Fixed size.
    - O(1) time complexity for random access.
    - Insertion and deletion may require shifting elements.
- **Linked List:**
    - Non-contiguous nodes with pointers/references.
    - Dynamic size.
    - O(n) time complexity for random access.
    - Efficient insertion and deletion.

**Discussion Points:**

- Compare time complexity for various operations.
- Discuss scenarios where one data structure is preferable over the other.

  

### 3. **Explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.**

**Answer:**

- **Time Complexity:**
    - Measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes concerning its input size.
    - Usually expressed using Big O notation.
- **Space Complexity:**
    - Measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm uses concerning its input size.
    - Also expressed using Big O notation.

**Discussion Points:**

- Provide examples of algorithms with different time and space complexities.
- Discuss trade-offs between time and space complexity.

### 4. **What is the difference between DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search)?**

**Answer:**

- **DFS:**
    - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    - Implemented using recursion or a stack.
- **BFS:**
    - Explores all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level.
    - Implemented using a queue.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss use cases for DFS and BFS.
- Compare time and space complexity of DFS and BFS.

  

### 6. **What is a binary search, and how does it work?**

**Answer:**

- **Binary Search:**
    - An efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array.
    - Divides the array in half and eliminates one half of the remaining elements at each step.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the time complexity of binary search.
- Explain scenarios where binary search is preferable.

### 7. **Explain the concept of hashing and its applications.**

**Answer:**

- **Hashing:**
    - Mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values (hash codes) using a hash function.
    - Used for fast data retrieval in data structures like hash tables.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss collision resolution techniques.
- Explain scenarios where hashing is beneficial.

### 8. **What is the difference between a tree and a graph?**

**Answer:**

- **Tree:**
    - Acyclic, connected, and undirected graph.
    - Hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.
- **Graph:**
    - Collection of nodes connected by edges.
    - Can be cyclic or acyclic.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss use cases for trees and graphs.
- Explain the concept of a directed graph.

  

### 10. **What is a binary tree, and how does it differ from a binary search tree (BST)?**

**Answer:**

- **Binary Tree:**
    - A tree data structure where each node has at most two children.
    - Children are referred to as the left child and the right child.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST):**
    - A binary tree with the property that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss advantages of using a binary search tree.
- Explain scenarios where a binary tree might be used without imposing the BST property.

### 11. **How would you find the middle point of a singly linked list?**

**Answer:**

One approach to finding the middle point of a singly linked list is to use two pointers - a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one node at a time, while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be in the middle.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the time complexity of finding the middle of a linked list using this approach.
- Explore alternative methods for finding the middle of a linked list.

### 12. **Explain the process of inserting a node into a binary search tree.**

**Answer:**

Inserting a node into a binary search tree involves comparing the value of the new node with the values of nodes in the tree and finding the appropriate position. If the value is less than the current node, it is inserted in the left subtree; if greater, in the right subtree.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the time complexity of inserting a node into a binary search tree.
- Explain how tree balancing might be necessary to maintain the advantages of a BST.

### 13. **What is a self-balancing binary search tree, and why might it be beneficial?**

**Answer:**

A self-balancing binary search tree automatically maintains its balance during insertions and deletions, ensuring that the tree remains relatively balanced. This helps prevent the tree from degenerating into a linked list, which would result in degraded performance.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss examples of self-balancing binary search trees (e.g., AVL tree, Red-Black tree).
- Explain the benefits of maintaining balance in a binary search tree.

These questions focus on linked lists, binary trees, and binary search trees, providing an opportunity to discuss the properties, differences, and applications of these data structures.

  

### 14. **Explain the concept of dynamic programming and provide an example problem where it can be applied.**

**Answer:**

- **Dynamic Programming:**
    - A technique for solving problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

**Example Problem: Fibonacci Sequence using Dynamic Programming.**

```Python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the concept of memoization in dynamic programming.
- Explore other scenarios where dynamic programming can be applied.

### 15. **What is a sorting algorithm, and explain the difference between bubble sort and merge sort.**

**Answer:**

- **Sorting Algorithm:**
    - An algorithm that arranges elements in a specific order (ascending or descending).
- **Bubble Sort:**
    - A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
    - Time complexity: O(n^2).
- **Merge Sort:**
    - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists.
    - Time complexity: O(n log n).

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the time complexity and efficiency of each algorithm.
- Explore scenarios where one sorting algorithm might be preferred over the other.

  

### 17. **What is the Traveling Salesman Problem, and how might it be solved?**

**Answer:**

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):**
    - A classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the original city.

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the complexity of solving the TSP.
- Explore algorithms for solving the TSP, such as the brute-force approach or heuristic methods like the nearest neighbour algorithm.

  

### 18. **Explain the concept of a greedy algorithm and provide an example problem where it can be applied.**

**Answer:**

- **Greedy Algorithm:**
    - An algorithmic paradigm that makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

**Example Problem: The Coin Change Problem using Greedy Algorithm.**

```Python
def greedy_coin_change(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    result = []
    for coin in coins:
        while amount >= coin:
            result.append(coin)
            amount -= coin
    return result
```

**Discussion Points:**

- Discuss the trade-offs and limitations of greedy algorithms.
