## **Overview**

This project aims to develop a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that processes candidate and job data to deliver actionable insights. Using **Apache Spark** and **BigQuery** on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, the platform enables advanced analytics and visualization via **BI tools** such as **Google Looker Studio**. The system’s primary objectives include matching candidates to jobs based on compatibility, analyzing hiring trends, and assessing company hiring efficiencies.

## **Key Objectives**
1. **Data Processing**: Clean and transform raw data from multiple sources (e.g., candidates, job descriptions, education, work experience) into structured, analyzable formats.
2. **Matching Algorithm**: Build a robust candidate-job matching algorithm using job description (JD) and curriculum vitae (CV) data to compute compatibility scores.
3. **BigQuery Integration**: Store processed data in BigQuery for querying and analytics.
4. **Visualization**: Use BI tools to create interactive dashboards highlighting hiring trends, skills distribution, and job metrics.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Data Storage**: Google Cloud Storage (GCS), BigQuery
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark (PySpark)
- **BI Tools**: Google Looker Studio, Tableau, or Power BI
- **GCP Services**: Cloud Storage, Cloud Dataproc, BigQuery

## **Implementation Plan**

### **1. Data Collection and Storage**

- Upload raw datasets in **CSV/JSON** format to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.
- Organize data using a clear schema:
    - `raw/` for unprocessed data.
    - `processed/` for cleaned and transformed data.

---

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
#### **Setup:**

- Deploy a **Cloud Dataproc** cluster for distributed data processing with **Apache Spark**.
#### **Tasks:**
- **Data Quality Checks**: Address null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Standardization**: Normalize text fields (e.g., company names, job titles).
- **Dataset Joins**: Merge datasets using foreign keys such as `candidate_id` and `job_id`.
- **Feature Engineering**:
    - Extract skill keywords from `technical_skills` and `non_technical_skills`.
    - Calculate `job tenure` from `start_date` and `end_date` in work experience records.
    - Parse and standardize `notice_period` fields into numeric values.

---

### **3. Data Transformation and Loading**
- **Save Processed Data**: Load transformed datasets into **BigQuery** with schemas such as:
    - **Candidates Table**: Includes personal details, work/education history, and matched job scores.
    - **Job Descriptions Table**: Contains key JD attributes and computed metrics.
- **BigQuery Views**:
    - Create aggregated views, e.g., `average_matching_scores` to calculate match scores by job.

---

### **4. Visualization with BI Tools**

#### **BI Integration**:
- Connect **BigQuery** to a BI tool like **Google Looker Studio**.
- Design dashboards with real-time updates and interactive components.

#### **Dashboard Insights**:
1. **Job Trends**:
    - Top skills in demand.
    - Jobs by location and industry.
2. **Candidate Analysis**:
    - Skills distribution (e.g., Python, SQL).
    - Notice period and degree-level breakdowns.
3. **Matching Metrics**:
    - Average matching scores per JD.
    - Interested candidate counts per JD.
4. **Company Metrics**:
    - Hiring efficiency (e.g., filled JDs vs. total JDs).
    - Average time to fill positions.

## **Metrics and Deliverables**

#### **Candidate-Level Metrics**

1. **Total Candidates Processed**:
    - Count of unique candidates (`cid`).
2. **Distribution by Degree Level**:
    - Count of candidates grouped by `degree` and `tier_level` (e.g., Tier 1 colleges).
3. **Skills Analysis**:
    - Top 10 technical and non-technical skills from the `skills` fields.
    - Skill popularity across candidates.
4. **Notice Period Analysis**:
    - Average notice period across candidates.
    - Count of candidates by notice period ranges (e.g., <30 days, 30–60 days, >60 days).
5. **Experience Distribution**:
    - Candidates grouped by total experience (`total_exp` from work experience table).
    - Count of freshers vs. experienced candidates.
6. **Candidate Location Insights**:
    - Candidates grouped by `location` (from work experience).

---

#### **Job-Level Metrics**

1. **Open vs. Filled JDs**:
    - Count of JDs with `jd_status_value` as open vs. filled.
2. **Jobs by Location and Industry**:
    - Distribution of JDs by `pref_location` and `company_name` industry (can be inferred from job names or company profiles).
3. **Job Designation and Skills Mapping**:
    - Top required skills for each `designation` extracted from `technical_skills`.
    - JDs grouped by designations and their respective required skill sets.
4. **Notice Period Trends**:
    - Average required notice period across JDs.
5. **Popular Job Roles**:
    - Count of JDs grouped by `designation`.

---
#### **Matching Insights**

1. **Average Matching Score per JD**:
    - Aggregate `jd_cv_matching_score` by `jd_id` to compute average matching scores.
2. **Top JDs by Candidate Interest**:
    - Top 10 JDs based on the count of candidates with `is_interested` as true.
3. **Skills Match Trends**:
    - Average skill match percentage for JDs with higher matching scores.
4. **Candidate-JD Overlap**:
    - Number of candidates interested in multiple JDs (grouped by `cid`).
5. **Skill Gaps Analysis**:
    - Compare top skills required in JDs vs. candidate skills to identify gaps.
    - For example:
```
Missing Skills = JD Technical Skills - Candidate Technical Skills
```
6. **Candidate Performance**:
    - Ranking candidates based on their matching scores across multiple JDs.
7. **Job Demand vs. Candidate Supply**:
    - Ratio of open JDs to total candidates for specific skills, locations, or industries.

---
#### **Company Efficiency Metrics**

1. **Hiring Completion Rate**:
    - Percentage of JDs filled vs. total JDs (`jd_status_value`).
    - Example:
```
Hiring Completion Rate = (Filled JDs / Total JDs) * 100
```
2. **Time to Fill Positions**:
    - Average time taken to fill a JD (`updated_at - created_at` for status change).
3. **Industry Trends**:
    - Number of jobs posted by industry or company (`company_name`).

---
### **Data Aggregations for Metrics**

- **Candidate Metrics**:
    - Use Spark aggregations (`groupBy`, `count`, `avg`) to compute counts and averages for candidate metrics.
- **Job Metrics**:
    - Extract and join `jd_id` and related fields from the JD table for aggregations.
- **Matching Metrics**:
    - Use filtering and grouping on `jd_cv_matching_score` and `is_interested`.
- **Efficiency Metrics**:
    - Compute time differences (`updated_at - created_at`) and group by `company_name`.

This approach covers a wide range of insights and adds significant value for students, preparing them to work on real-world hiring and analytics problems.

## **Optimization and Enhancements**

### **BigQuery Cost Optimization**

- Use **partitioned tables** for efficient querying.
- Allocate **BigQuery Slots** to control query costs.

### **Automations and Add-ons**

1. Automate the ETL pipeline using **Apache Airflow**.
2. Introduce real-time candidate-job matching via **Pub/Sub** or **Kafka**.
3. Add sentiment analysis to evaluate JD and CV tone.
