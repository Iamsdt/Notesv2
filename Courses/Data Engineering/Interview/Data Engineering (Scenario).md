        *   **Data Schema Management:** A schema registry (e.g., AWS Glue Schema Registry or Confluent Schema Registry) will be used to define and manage the schema of the JSON data. This ensures that data is consistent and backward-compatible. Each event type (product view, add-to-cart, etc.) might have its own schema or use the same with slight modifications.
    *   **Product Catalog (Batch):**
        *   **Technology:** AWS S3 (or Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage).
        *   **Process:** The CSV file is uploaded to an S3 bucket when the product catalog is updated.
        *   **Data Format:** CSV is stored as-is initially.
        *   **Data Schema Management:** Data schema will be handled during processing using Apache Spark.

2.  **Data Processing Layer:**

    *   **Mobile App Events (Real-time):**
        *   **Technology:** AWS Kinesis Data Analytics (or Azure Stream Analytics or Google Cloud Dataflow).

            *   **Data Transformation:** Flatten nested JSON objects, convert data types, and map schema based on the schema registry.
            *   **Data Quality Checks:** Implement checks for missing fields, invalid data types, and outliers. Records that fail checks will be sent to a separate error stream for investigation and correction.
            *   **Data Enrichment:** Enrich event data (e.g., adding user location information, device information using lookup tables if required).
        *   **Output:** Processed event data is sent to both a data lake (for analytical purposes) and a data store optimized for real-time queries (e.g., Amazon DynamoDB or Cassandra).
    *   **Product Catalog (Batch):**
        *   **Technology:** AWS Glue (or Azure Data Factory or Google Cloud Dataflow) with Apache Spark.
        *   **Process:** A Glue job reads the CSV data from S3. The job performs:
            *   **Data Transformation:** Data conversion, data cleaning (removing invalid or corrupt data), deduplication, schema validation, and type conversion.
            *   **Data Quality Checks:** Data validation and business rules enforcement. Records that fail checks are moved to a quarantine location for further investigation.
        *   **Output:** Cleaned, transformed catalog data is written to a data warehouse, data lake, or similar data storage solution.

3.  **Data Storage Layer:**
    *   **Mobile App Events (Real-time):**
        *   **Data Lake:** Amazon S3 (or Azure Data Lake Storage or Google Cloud Storage) for long-term storage and analysis in Parquet format for query performance.
        *   **Real-time Datastore:** Amazon DynamoDB (or Azure Cosmos DB or Google Cloud Datastore) for low-latency queries by the application.
    *   **Product Catalog:**
        *   **Data Warehouse:** Amazon Redshift (or Azure Synapse Analytics or Google BigQuery) for analytical reporting.

4.  **Orchestration and Monitoring:**

        *   **Data Format:** Raw JSON events are sent to Kafka topics.
        *   **Data Schema Management:** Confluent Schema Registry integrated with Kafka. The schema registry is used for schema definition, version control, and compatibility checks.
    *   **Product Catalog (Batch):**
        *   **Technology:** A dedicated staging server or S3 bucket for initial upload.
        *   **Process:** The CSV file is uploaded to this staging area.
        *   **Data Format:** CSV format is kept for processing.
        *   **Data Schema Management:** Data schema will be defined in Apache Spark jobs and registered in the schema registry before processing.

2.  **Data Processing Layer:**

    *   **Mobile App Events (Real-time):**
        *   **Technology:** Apache Spark Streaming with Kafka integration or Apache Flink.
        *   **Process:** Spark Streaming or Flink consumes data from Kafka topics and performs:
            *   **Data Transformation:** Flattens JSON, transforms data types, and ensures schema compatibility through schema registry checks.
            *   **Data Quality Checks:** Executes rules for missing fields, invalid data, or outliers. Invalid records will be written to separate Kafka error topic for later processing.
            *   **Data Enrichment:** Enrichment of event data using lookup tables.

### Answer 2: migrating data from an on-premise relational database to a scalable analytics environment

**Scenario Recap:**

*   **Current State:** On-premise relational database (transactional) experiencing slow query performance during heavy reporting periods (end of month).
*   **Goal:** Build an efficient, scalable analytics solution to handle current and future data, minimize impact on the transactional database, and support complex reporting needs.
*   **Reporting Needs:** Complex joins, aggregations, and time-series analysis across multiple data sources (order, customer, marketing).

**Proposed Solution: Migrating to a Cloud Data Warehouse**

Given the need for scalability and reduced maintenance overhead, I recommend migrating to a cloud-based data warehouse solution. This approach allows us to leverage cloud infrastructure and services to address the limitations of the current on-premise setup.

**1. Assessment and Planning:**

*   **Data Audit:** Analyze data schemas, volumes, dependencies, and data types in the current on-premise database (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle). Identify the key tables for reporting purposes (order, customer, marketing data) and any sensitive data that requires special handling.
*   **Reporting Requirements:** Document all required reports and analytics, including the specific joins, aggregations, and time-series analysis needed. Also note expected query latency, frequency, and any dashboard requirements.
*   **Data Governance:** Define data quality standards, data retention policies, and security requirements (e.g., encryption, access control, masking PII). Implement data cataloging as well to ensure data discoverability.
*   **Technology Selection:** Based on the above points, choose a suitable cloud data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Azure Synapse Analytics). Consider factors like performance, cost, scalability, ease of use, integration capabilities, and existing organizational skills. In this case, let's assume we chose **Snowflake**.

**2. Data Migration Strategy:**

*   **Initial Migration (Full Load):**
    *   **Extraction:** Use a secure connector or ETL tool (e.g., AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), Azure Data Factory, Talend, Informatica) to extract data from the on-premise database. The extraction should be performed during off-peak hours to minimize impact on the operational database.
    *   **Transformation:** Perform some basic transformations like data type casting, renaming, and standardization as needed during migration.
    *   **Loading:** Load the data into staging tables in Snowflake. The focus is to perform initial load in a performant manner with minimal transformations to ensure faster initial load.
*   **Incremental Migration:**
    *   **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Implement a CDC mechanism (e.g., using database triggers, log-based replication with tools like Debezium or AWS DMS) to capture changes in the source database after the initial load.
    *   **Extraction:** Capture only changed data (inserts, updates, deletes) from the transactional database.
    *   **Transformation:** Apply required transformations for analytical purposes in the ETL/ELT process.
    *   **Loading:** Load only the changes into the target data warehouse (Snowflake), keeping the data in sync.

**3. ETL/ELT Process:**

We'll use an **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** approach, leveraging the compute power of the data warehouse (Snowflake in our case) for transformations.

*   **Extract:** Extract data from the source (on-premise database or CDC stream).
*   **Load:** Load the data into staging tables in Snowflake as quickly as possible. The staging tables should replicate the source data structures.

*   **Output:** Store the transformed data in the analytical tables within Snowflake.

**4. Data Warehouse Architecture:**

*   **Star Schema/Snowflake Schema:**
    *   Design a star schema or snowflake schema with fact tables (e.g., orders, sales) and dimension tables (e.g., customers, products, dates).
    *   Fact tables will contain measures and foreign keys pointing to dimension tables.
    *   Dimension tables will contain descriptive attributes and keys.
    *   This structure allows for efficient querying by aggregating data based on dimensions.
*   **Partitioning and Clustering:**
    *   Implement partitioning based on date or time to improve query performance and reduce scan sizes for time-series queries.
