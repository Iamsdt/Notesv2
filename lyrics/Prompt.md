Music Title: Longing for Krishna's Presence

Lyrics: **Verse 1:**

In the quiet of the morning, as the sun begins to rise,

I imagine Krishna walking by, with a gentle, knowing smile.

Sharing a simple meal together, laughter in the air,

In every mundane moment, feeling his love beyond compare.

**Chorus:**

Oh, to see you with human eyes, to feel your presence near,

To walk beside you in the market, to hear your whispered prayer.

In every joy and sorrow, in every tear and smile,

I long to connect with you, my Krishna, my divine child.

**Verse 2:**

In the marketplace we wander, hands entwined, side by side,

You laugh at my mistakes, and I find peace in your wise.

Through the ups and downs of life, your guidance is my light,

In every step I take, I feel your divine might.

**Chorus:**

Oh, to see you with human eyes, to feel your presence near,

To walk beside you in the market, to hear your whispered prayer.

In every joy and sorrow, in every tear and smile,

I long to connect with you, my Krishna, my divine child.

**Bridge:**

But when the night falls heavy, and you're far beyond my sight,

I feel the pain of separation, the longing, the endless night.

Yet in my heart, I know you're near, in every breath I take,

My faith in you unwavering, though you're not always awake.

**Chorus:**

Oh, to see you with human eyes, to feel your presence near,

To walk beside you in the market, to hear your whispered prayer.

In every joy and sorrow, in every tear and smile,

I long to connect with you, my Krishna, my divine child.

**Outro:**

So I pray for your presence, in this world so full of strife,

To see you as a human, to feel your love in life.

Oh, Krishna, my beloved, my guide, my sweet friend,

In every moment, I surrender, until we are at last, one end.
